# GoFundMe Raised Money Scraper
The code in the jupyter 'Notebook.ipynb' goes through a list of links in a csv file called 'links.csv' and creates a csv called 'results.csv' with information about how much money was raised for each GoFundMe link.

Check out the included links.csv file to see how to set it up and the results.csv file to see what the output looks like.

This was originally created for [2021-2022 Boulder County fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Boulder_County_fires) to help people donate to the families whose homes were lost.
